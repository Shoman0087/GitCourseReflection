How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it compares the two versions of the code and shows what are the differencies so that makes it easy to say where is the bug in the code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    some times we need to restore some codes we changed and it's hard and space wasting to save every version of code in a seoerated file so by having the access to the whle history of the file we can reflect any old code in the same file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually

    pros:
    - more flixable
    cons
    - some times the programmer forget to commit

    Auto
    pros
    - every thing will be commited without forgetting anything
    cons
    - maybe too many commits for small changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git is designed for codes while google docs designed for any text data, in the code case sometimes many file dependes on each other, for example file A call a function the exist in file B so if the programmer change the function parameters in file B he should change them also in file A so using one commit make it easy to restore changes in one command.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By exploring the history of commits then compare any followed versions togather

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    since i have the control over the history and i can revert any changes i will be able to try any change even if i am not sure if that change will keep the code running well

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to keep traking my code and to share it with my team
